# Image Comparison Slider

This project is a simple image comparison slider that allows you to compare two images side by side. You can drag the slider to reveal the before and after versions of the images. It also checks the aspect ratio of the images to ensure they are the same before allowing comparison.

## Features

- Compare two images side by side with a draggable slider.
- Select 'before' and 'after' images from your device.
- Check the aspect ratio of the selected images to ensure they are the same.
- Provides visual feedback when images are selected and when aspect ratio requirements are not met.
